# Digit-Classification
Neural Network For Handwritten Digits Classification | Deep Learning  (Tensorflow2.0)
 we will build our first neural network in tensorflow and python for handwritten digits classification. We will first build a very simple neural network with only input and output layer. After that we will add a hidden layer and check how the performance of our model changes.
